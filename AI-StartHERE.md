# AI-StartHERE.md

Welcome to the pcSHOWme Knowledge Base & Creative AI Workspace

## 1. Project Purpose
This repository powers AI-assisted workflows for music, video, and storytelling. It brings together creative content, automation scripts, and semantic indexing to help artists, technologists, and AI agents collaborate, organize, and grow a modular knowledge base. The goal: enable rapid, meaningful creation and curation of songs, projects, stories, and multimedia—while supporting transparent, queryable knowledge for both humans and AI.

## 2. File Structure Overview
- `/Songs/` — Song projects, lyrics, and related creative assets
- `/Projects/` — Major initiatives, including flagship projects like Samaritan
- `/uplift/`, `/pSm-AI/`, `/YouTube/`, `/Stories/` — Thematic or platform-based content collections
- `.md` files — Human-readable summaries with YAML frontmatter, project notes, and takeaways
- `.map` files — Semantic metadata maps (YAML): topics, subtopics, anchors, tags, and update timestamps
- `.cht` files — Raw chat transcripts or stubs referencing source content
- `AI-StartHERE.md` — This onboarding and documentation file

Each major folder and chat session is indexed with `.md` (summary), `.map` (semantic map), and `.cht` (transcript/stub) files for modular, queryable access.

## 3. Instructions for AI Agents
- **Intent Recognition:** Use `.md` summaries and `.map` semantic maps to understand project goals, context, and relationships between files.
- **Content Navigation:** Follow anchors and topics in `.map` files to locate relevant knowledge or creative assets.
- **Grounding:** When responding, reference the most recent `.md` and `.map` files for up-to-date context. Do not assume access to private grounding files unless explicitly provided in the session.
- **Collaboration:** When new content is added, update or request updates to `.md` and `.map` files to keep the knowledge base current.

## 4. About the External Private Grounding File
A private grounding file exists for the project owner’s use. It contains sensitive or proprietary context to enhance AI session continuity and personal workflow. This file is **not** included in the public repo and is never shared or exposed.

- Only the project owner and their AI sessions may reference this file.
- It is used to provide richer, more personalized context between chat sessions.
- If you are not the owner, you do not have access to this file.

## 5. Note for GitHub Copilot and Other AI Agents
**GitHub Copilot does not access the external private grounding file.**

- Copilot and other public AI agents only use the files and context available in this repository.
- The private grounding file is reserved for the owner’s direct AI sessions and is not accessible to Copilot or any agent running in this repo.
