Beliefs and Values

These are the beliefs I have held ever since I was young. I always wondered why people had to polarize and politicize so much. Even then, I tried to do my part through the Milwaukee Rescue Missions, doing inner-city park concerts with my band "Torn Veil," fostering racial and denominational healing.
