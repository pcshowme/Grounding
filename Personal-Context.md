## Beliefs and Values

### Personal Reflections

These are the beliefs I have held ever since I was young. I always wondered why people had to polarize and politicize so much. Even then, I tried to do my part through the Milwaukee Rescue Missions, doing inner-city park concerts with my band "Torn Veil," fostering racial and denominational healing.

After Deb and I got married, I gave up music and sold everything for a few years. When God brought it back into my life, my first worship experience was playing bass at an all-black church with no other white people (or other musicians). It was just me, my bass, and a congregation of about 200 people.
